# Crowdfunding-Data
First project for Module 1

Crowdfunding Analysis report

	Crowdfunding data can show us many different factors when trying to find conclusions in the data. When searching for averages and deviations in the results, I found successes had a higher overall rating across multiple categories comparing failed outcomes. The success rate had a higher maximum outcome showing that future company campaigns are worth the commitment made and should continue to work for their goals. The arts are a favorite to be desired and should continue to be pursued. Plays in particular had the most funding with the most failed results and the highest success. The best results for company-wide goals had a higher success rate when the target goal range was within fifteen thousand to twenty-five thousand. Some interesting results were that having a slightly lower goal of ten thousand to fifteen thousand had higher failed rates. 
 
	Limitations can be found within the data in multiple specific categories. The amount of companies given to us in the crowdfunding analysis is limited to only about a thousand rows of data. This could show us two separate situations when concluding. We could view this as the category theater with the highest amount of funding, or it can be viewed as limited data for multiple separate groups. Food was an interesting category to think about when using the idea of limited data. 
 
	Additional data analysis could also be made with the data given that wasn’t used in the table presented. Finding locations of the funding could show an interesting point where data was recorded and tracked. Specifically, showing a bar graph with separate countries and possible currencies used to reach each company’s goal. That could show us which category favored which country, or if it wasn’t specific to a certain country.
